# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** Augest 3 2025

We take your privacy seriously. This application is designed for personal use and does not store, process, or transmit any user data beyond what is necessary for its operation.

## 1. Information Collection

This app does not collect or transmit any user information.  
All OAuth tokens and data access occur locally on the user's device.

We do not use analytics, cookies, or any tracking mechanisms.

## 2. OAuth and Scopes

The app uses Google OAuth 2.0 to request the following scopes:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` - access to Google Drive
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly` - access to Google Drive when read-only mode is enabled
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/docs` - access to Google Docs

These scopes are required only to enable file interaction and confirm identity. No data is stored, logged, or shared.

## 3. No Third-Party Access

No user data is ever sent to any third party.  
We do not run a server or API that stores or forwards data.

Google may log your OAuth interactions in accordance with its [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy), which is separate from this application.

## 4. Changes

This policy may be updated. Changes will be published to this document with the effective date modified accordingly.
